    <h1>Welcome to LearnC#</h1>
    <br>
    <section>
      <p>About us</p>
      <p>On this website you can learn the basics of the programming-language C#,
      which you can program on editors like visual studio code or visual studio.
      You will learn here the structure of a C#-program, how you can write and issue something in a terminal,
      process data and learn what types of data there are. You will find here exact descriptions, which will help you.
      Have fun at the programming.</p>

      <h2>1. Basic structure of a C# program</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>A basic C# program is categorized in namespaces, classes and methods.</p>
      <p>The following example shows the basic skeleton of a C#-program</p>
<pre class="border">
namespace Introduction
{
      class program
      {
              static void Main()
              {

              }
      }
}</pre>
      <p>In the beginning you write all commands between the brackets of the "<strong class="command">static void Main()</strong>"-method.</p>
    </section>
    <br>
    <section>
      <h2>2. Basic output</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>If you want to print something on the terminal, for example "Hello World!", you use the commmand
        "<strong class="command">System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")</strong>"</p>
        <p>Everything that is written between those brackets will be printed.</p>
      <p>You implement this so: </p>
<pre class="border">
namespace Introduction
{
      class program
      {
              static void Main()
              {
                      System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
              }
      }
}</pre>
      <p>It´s important that you end a command with this symbol ";". So the program knows that the command is here finished.</p>

      <h2>3. Different Variable types and their usage</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In programming there is something called Variabletypes, or Datatypes, with which you can declare the characteristic of a variable.</p>
      <p>There are two types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>value types</li>
        <li>reference types</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will discuss later, which one does what.</p>
      <h3>Value types</h3>
      <p>They are catagorized in three Sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Integer types</li>
        <li>Floating-point types</li>
        <li>Bool</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Integer types</h4>
      <p>With integer types you can declare an integer value.</p>
      <p>This is the list with the different integer types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>sbyte</li>
        <p>A sbyte is a signed 8-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between -128 and 127.</p>
        <br>
        <li>byte</li>
        <p>A byte is a unsigned 8-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between 0 and 255(2^8).</p>
        <br>
        <li>short</li>
        <p>A short is a signed 16-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between -32,768 and 32,767.</p>
        <br>
        <li>ushort</li>
        <p>A ushort is a unsigned 16-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between 0 and 65,535(2^16).</p>
        <br>
        <li>int</li>
        <p>A int is a signed 32-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.</p>
        <br>
        <li>uint</li>
        <p>A uint is a unsigned 32-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between 0 and 4,294,967,295(2^32).</p>
        <br>
        <li>long</li>
        <p>A long is a signed 64-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between
          -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.</p>
        <br>
        <li>ulong</li>
        <p>A ulong is a unsigned 64-bits integer. That means you can declare it with a number between 0 and 18,446,744,073,709,551,615(2^64).</p>
        <br>
      </ul>
      <p>At the beginnning, we would recommend to use int.</p>

      <h4>Floating-point types</h4>
      <p>With floating-point types you can declare a floating-point number value.</p>
      <p>This is the list with the different floating-point types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>float</li>
        <p>A float is a signed 4-byte float. That means you can declare it with a number between ±1.5 x 10^-45 and ±3.4 x 10^38.</p>
        <br>
        <li>double</li>
        <p>A double is a signed 8-byte float. That means you can declare it with a number between ±5.0 × 10^-324 and ±1.7 × 10^308.</p>
        <br>
        <li>decimal</li>
        <p>A decimal is a signed 16-byte float. That means you can declare it with a number between ±1.0 x 10^-28 and ±7.9228 x 10^28.</p>
        <br>
      </ul>

      <h4>Bool</h4>
      A bool describes if a statement is <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</p>
      <br>
      <h5>Declaration and Initialization</h5>
      <p>You can declare it like this: </p>
      <strong class="command">int number1;</strong>
      <br>
      <strong class="command">double number2;</strong>
      <br>
      <strong class="command">bool isvalid;</strong>
      <br>
      <p>After the Valuetype comes the variable-name</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you want to initialize it, you must give the variable-name and a value:</p>
      <strong class="command">number1 = 5;</strong>
      <br>
      <strong class="command">number2 = 1.5;</strong>
      <br>
      <strong class="command">isvalid = true;</strong>
      <br>
      <p>You can do both in one row:</p>
      <strong class="command">int number1 = 5;</strong>
      <br>
      <strong class="command">double number2 = 1.5;</strong>
      <br>
      <strong class="command">bool isvalid = true;</strong>
      <br>
