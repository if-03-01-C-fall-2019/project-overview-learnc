      <p>On this website you can learn the basics of the programming-language C#,
      which you can program on editors like visual studio code or visual studio.
      You will learn here the structure of a C#-program, how you can write and issue something in a terminal,
      process data and learn what types of data there are. You will find here exact descriptions, which will help you.
      Have fun at the programming.</p>

      <h2>5. Junctions and logical Operators</h2>
      <br>
      <p>To actually have your program do something besides simple mathematic operations,
        you'll need logical operators. Here's a list of all logic operators:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Operations</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"=="</td>
          <td>This is used to check if 2 values are equal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"!="</td>
          <td>This is used to check if 2 values aren't equal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"<"</td>
          <td>This is used to check if the value to the left of it is smaller than the value to the right</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"<="</td>
          <td>This is used to check if the value on the left is smaller or equal to the value on the right</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>">"</td>
          <td>This is used to check if the value to the left of it is bigger than the value to the right</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>">="</td>
          <td>This is used to check if the value on the left is bigger or equal to the value on the right</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- <br>
      <p>You can also use !([Condition]) to check if an entire expression is false.</p>
      <br> -->
      <p>You can use this operations in</p>
