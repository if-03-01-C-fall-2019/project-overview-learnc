      <p>About us</p>
      <p>On this website you can learn the basics of the programming-language C#,
      which you can program on editors like visual studio code or visual studio.
      You will learn here the structure of a C#-program, how you can write and issue something in a terminal,

      <p>A basic C# program is categorized in namespaces, classes and methods.</p>

      <p>The following example shows the basic skeleton of a C#-program</p>


<pre class="border">
namespace Introduction
{
      class program
      {
              static void Main()
              {
